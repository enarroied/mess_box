This is a personal "mess box" ‚Äì a collection of small code snippets, drafts, and mini-projects. I use this repository to store code bits that are too small to warrant their own full repository but that I want to keep track of for future reference and reuse. 

### What's Inside?

Probably Python stuff, mostly notebooks, but who knows, anything I want, really.

### Contributions

This is primarily a personal repository. While external contributions aren't expected, feel free to fork it if you find anything useful!

### License

This project is licensed under the GPL-3.0 License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details. But considering that the code inside is just small tests, the license makes little sense.
