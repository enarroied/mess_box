# Using Great Tables

I heard about [this library](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/articles/intro.html) in [Talk Python to Me (episode 492)](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/492/great-tables). I've thought before that it's odd to have all those nice dataviz libraries, and no way to create nice tables... 

This is just a notebook with a table (great I hope!) of Paris Olympic medals, from a dataset I added to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ericnarro/all-olympic-medals-until-2024-before-paris-games).
